# stacko - the useless, bug-ridden stacklang
A stack-based toy language inspired by PostScript and [Nari](https://git.exactas.uba.ar/mdelrio/Nari3)

**Documentation in progress**

### why did you build stacko?
_stacko_ was born for fun and exploration, the act of creating a
programing language (or at least implement some ideas) is an insightful
experience that sheds a light on the [human nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM4WW5yyuu0)
of all the other languages, their respective creators and communities.

The design of stacko is meant to be simplistic because this allows easier
explanations of _how_ it works, researching for fun is the ultimate goal!
